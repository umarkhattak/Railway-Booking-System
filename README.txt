Railway Booking System

In this project, we designed and implemented a relational database system to support the operations of an online railway booking system. 

Used HTML for the user interface, MySQL for the database server, and Java, Javascript, and JDBC for connectivity between the user interface and database server. 

Worked with MySQL server and AWS EC2.
